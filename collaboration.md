 # Git hub collaboration

feat/23-sep
## Github collaboration is the way different people can work on the same project together.

#### This means that the people added to the collaborator's list can push,merge, and do other kinds of similar things on the project.
 
## The key aspects of GitHub collaboration:

#### 1. Repositories: Projects are housed in repositories, which store all project files, including code, documentation, and version history.

#### 2. Adding Collaborators: Repository owners can invite other GitHub users as collaborators, granting them access to contribute to the project. This is done through the repository's settings, typically under the "Manage access" or "Collaborators and teams" section.

#### 3. Cloning Repositories: Collaborators clone the repository to their local machines using ``` git clone ```, creating a local copy of the project files.

#### 4. Making Changes: Collaborators work on the code locally, making additions, modifications, or deletions. It is common practice to work on separate branches for new features or bug fixes to avoid conflicts.

#### 5. Committing Changes: After making changes, collaborators stage and commit them to their local repository using ``` git add ``` and ``` git commit ```.

#### 6. Pushing and Pulling: Collaborators push their committed changes to the remote GitHub repository using ``` git push ``` , making them available to others. They also regularly pull changes from the remote repository using the command ``` git pull ``` to ensure their local copy is up-to-date with the latest contributions from other team members.

#### 7. Pull Requests: When a collaborator wants to merge their changes into the main codebase, they create a pull request. This allows for code review, discussion, and approval by other team members before the changes are integrated.

#### 8. Issue Tracking and Discussions: GitHub provides features like issues to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks, and discussions for broader conversations about the project.
