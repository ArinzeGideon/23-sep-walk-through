# Git fetch 

##### When you are working on a project with github,sometimes you need to get the lates changes from it. Git fetch downloads changes from the remote branch on github and stores them in your local mechine

##### It checking out what's new on the remote without making any changes to your local files,git fetch is like looking at the new stuff but not taking it.

git fetch only downloads new data from a remote repository,but it doesn't
integrate any of the downloaded data into your working files.
All it does is provide a view of the data.

#### ``` # git fetch <branch_name> ```

#### ``` # git fetch origin <branch_name> ```




## ``` git fetch ``` the younger brother of ``` git pull```
