# Git merge

 If we branch of the main branch, make some changes while the 
 main branch is being updated then use 
 ### ``` git merge ``` 
 to bring the changes back to the main branch. We'll end up with a merge commit caused by merging the latest commit from the feature branch with the lates commit with the mainn branch and each time we use ``` git merge ``` it's going to create a new merge commit which can clutter our git history.
